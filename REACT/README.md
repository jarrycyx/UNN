# Official Repository for "Ultra-efficient causal deep learning for Dynamic CSA-AKI Detection Using Minimal Variables"


## ✍️ Paper summary

REACT (Real-time Evaluation and Anticipation with Causal disTillation): a causal deep learning approach that
combines the universal approximation abilities of neural networks with
causal discovery to develop REACT, a reliable and generalizable
model to predict a patient's risk of developing CSA-AKI within the next
48 hours.
